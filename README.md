# Task handler API

This is a task handler API implemented with basic CRUD functions. It is built with gradle and written in java 11.
### Instructions on how to use application

1. Clone the repo and open the folder in IntelliJ. Make sure gradle is installed as well.
2. Build the gradle application.
3. Go to the "DemoApplication.java" file under "src/main/java/com/example/demo" which contains the main method to start the application, and click the green arrow on
the left side margin to run the application.
4. Use postman to tap into the endpoints and test the application. The application runs on localhost 8080.

### Assumptions made
